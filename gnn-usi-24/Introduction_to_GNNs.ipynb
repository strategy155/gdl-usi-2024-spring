    "## Preliminaries\n",
    "\n",
    "We denote by $G\\left\\langle V, E \\right\\rangle$ the graph with nodes in $V$ connected by edges in $E$, and we let $N=|V|$ be the number of nodes. We represent the edge from node $u_i$ to node $u_j$, as the tuple $(u_i, u_j)$. To account for (optional) edge weights, we represent the graph connectivity also by means of the **adjacency matrix** $\\mathbf{A} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}$, whose element $a_{ij}$ is the weight of the edge $(u_i, u_j)$, with $a_{ij} = 0$ if $(u_i, u_j) \\not\\in E$. We denote by $\\textbf{X} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d_x}$ the **node-attribute matrix** containing information about the nodes.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Graph Neural Network\n",
    "\n",
    "We call **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** a generic neural network featuring (a stack of) parametric layers taking as input a graph connectivity. **Graph convolutions** are an example of such layers. In the following, we denote by $\\mathbf{H}^l \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times d^l_h}$ the node features at the $l$-th layer of the network. A simple recipe for graph convolutions is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\mathbf{H}^{l+1} = \\sigma\\left(\\mathbf{\\tilde{A}}\\mathbf{H}^{l}\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}^l \\right) , \\tag{1}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\boldsymbol{\\Theta}^l \\in \\mathbb{R}^{d_h^l \\times d_h^{l+1}}$ is a learnable parameter matrix and $\\sigma$ is a nonlinear activation function. The matrix $\\mathbf{\\tilde{A}} \\in \\mathbb{R}^{N \\times N}$ is a **Graph Shift Operator**, i.e., an $N \\times N$ matrix such that\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\widetilde{a}_{ij} = 0 \\text{ for } (i, j) \\not\\in E \\text{ and } i \\ne j.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "A more expressive way to represent and build graph-powered layers is through the **message-passing** paradigm.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Message passing\n",
    "\n",
    "The message-passing equation is the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\DeclareMathOperator*{\\aggr}{\\texttt{Aggr}}\n",
    "\\mathbf{h}^{l+1}_i =\\gamma^l_{\\theta} \\left( \\mathbf{h}^l_i, \\aggr_{j \\in N(i)} \\left\\{ \\phi^l_{\\theta} \\left(\\mathbf{h}^l_i, \\mathbf{h}^l_j\\right) \\right\\} \\right)  \\tag{2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $N(i)$ is the set of neighbors of the $i$-th node, $\\phi^l_{\\theta}$ and $\\gamma^l_{\\theta}$ are called **message** and **update functions** and are generic, differentiable, nonlinear functions (e.g., MLPs), and $\\texttt{Aggr}$ is a permutation invariant, differentiable\n",

    "PyTorch Geometric offers a simple API to implement custom PyTorch-ready message-passing layers. We will create a layer implementing Eq. 6 by inheriting from [`torch_geometric.nn.MessagePassing`](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/tutorial/create_gnn.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The `MessagePassing` base class allows us to create message-passing graph neural networks by handling message propagation automatically. This is done through methods and attributes of the class that ease the code implementation of the message-passing inner functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* When we initialize a class inheriting from `MessagePassing` we need to initialize the parent class with the `super(...)` call. The base `MessagePassing` class has important arguments that we can specify to manipulate the message propagation/aggregation logic:\n",
    "  \n",
    "  * `aggr=\"add\"` defines the aggregation scheme to use (`\"add\"`, `\"mean\"` or `\"max\"`);\n",
    "  * `flow=\"source_to_target\"` defines the flow direction of message passing (either `\"source_to_target\"` or `\"target_to_source\"`);\n",
    "  * `node_dim=-2` defines along which axis to propagate the messages (i.e., the dimension of the nodes in the input tensor).\n",
    "\n",
    "  The default is `MessagePassing(aggr=\"add\", flow=\"source_to_target\", node_dim=-2)`.\n",
    "\n",
    "* The method `MessagePassing.propagate(edge_index, size=None, **kwargs)` is in charge of starting messages propagation and is called inside the `forward()` function. It takes as input the `edge_index` (i.e., the graph connectivity) and all additional data needed to build the messages as keyword arguments. The `size` argument can be used to exchange messages in generic (sparse) assignment matrices of shape `[N, M]` by passing `size=(N, M)`. If `size=None`, `edge_index` is assumed to represent a square matrix (e.g., the adjacency matrix).\n",
    "\n",
    "* Our message function will be inside the `MessagePassing.message(...)` method. It *can* take any argument which was initially passed to `propagate()`. Also, tensors passed to `propagate()` can be mapped to receiver and sender nodes by appending `_i` or `_j` to the variable name, e.g. `x_i` and `x_j`, respectively. Note that `_i` represents the central nodes that aggregate information and `_j` are the neighboring nodes when `flow=\"source_to_target\"` (default).\n",
    "\n",
    "* The update function can be either implemented using the `MessagePassing.update(aggr_out, ...)` method or simply inside the `forward()` function after `propagate()` (we'll go for the second choice). The `update()` function takes as the first argument the output of aggregation and then any argument initially passed to `propagate()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's get our hands dirty! We now implement our Message-Passing Neural Network (**`MPNN`**) using the `MessagePassing` class."
